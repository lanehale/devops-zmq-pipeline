## Input Video

The pipeline processes a 30 FPS input video stream.

- Use any short 30 FPS MP4 file as input (e.g., download a public domain clip or record a few seconds with your phone).
- Place it in this /data folder as `sample_video_30fps.mp4`.
- (No video included in repo to keep it lightweight — works with any 30 FPS MP4.)
